# custard

custard window manager

custard (stylized in all lowercase letters) is a stacking/floating window manager for X.Org. It arranges windows on a grid, i.e. there is a virtual grid on the screen, windows are positioned by X and Y coordinates, as well as sized over X and Y coordinates.

You could think of custard as a stacking/floating window manager that acts and looks more like a tiling window manager.

custard is based on subtle, 2bwm, swm, and howm. Some of the codebase was based off of code from the various projects listed, and as such, thanks, and credit where due to the creators of said projects.
